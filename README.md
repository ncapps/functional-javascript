# Notes and Working Examples from Functional Javascript by Michael Fogus

## Chapter 1. Introducing Functional JavaScript
  - Identify an abstraction and build a function for it
  - Use existing functions to build more complex abstractions
  - Pass existing functions to other functions to build even more complex abstractions
  - Functional programming works best when implemented with data abstractions

## Chapter 2. First-Class Functions and Applicative Programming
  - First-class functions can be treated like any other piece of data:
    - Store in a variable
    - Store in an array slot
    - Store in an object field
    - Created as needed
    - Passed to other functions
    - Returned from functions
  - Higher-order functions can take a function as an argument and/or return a function as a result
  - Applicative programming techniques are effective when working with collections of data

## Chapter 3. Variable Scope and Closures
